# brainfcked
HaxeFlixel game created after initial breakup of Warwick Game Jam group
Games plan was a top-down roguelike (daring) where the upgrade and stats system was
tied to values in a tape that could be manipulated by the language brainf\*ck.
The project currently lies in two parts, the first part the top down shooter with working character and enemies.
The second is a compiler of the language brainf\*ck to be tied into the project when it reached a more complete stage.
